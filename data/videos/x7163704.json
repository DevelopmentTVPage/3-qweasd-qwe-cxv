    "transcripts": "Hey I'm Ming Tsai from Simply Ming. Let me tell you a great way to use this brand new All Clad steamer. I'd love steaming food but one trick here with any steamer is actually flavor my water. I take a big pinch of tea. Rhis is Black leechy tea and then actually just takes any off flavor that's in the water but actually gives you a really nuance tea flabor when you're steaming. Now here we have some salmon that I'm just going toseason up with some salt and pepper. And you know we can do a lot of steaming in Asian cooking of course everyone knows how healthy it is for you and it is but it's also does not necessarily mean you're have bland foof. Everyone thinks steaming is bland. If you could cook it right and add the right little touch to it, it can be delicious. So with the salmon I'm going to take this beautiful piece a bok choy, cut in half, there is a little core here in bok choi. You just take the core out okay. Two pieces is fine. 1 per piece a salmon. And then we're going to steam this up. It's going to take about I'd say about eight minutes total. so take the bok choi there,  take these two pieces of salmon and lay them in the middle. In about eight minutes, you're going to have perfectly cooked salmon. Check this out what this looks like after about eight minutes . So on the bottom of the pan by the way is a banana leaf. You can use cabbage leaf anything any of that would work. Nice piece of bok choi. Take this piece of salmon and the reason you put that in to help the salmon from not sticking. There you go. Then what I have here are some really hot oil and I'm gonna add just a pinch of ginger, garlic, fermented black beans, and there's your wonderful sauce. I'm just going to put that right on top. That's how you can get great flavor into a steam samina bok choy dish. Peace and good eating. Funding for Simply Ming is provided by. All-clad is bonded construction, all-clad is functional design all-clad is professional equipment, all-clad is a state of mind.",

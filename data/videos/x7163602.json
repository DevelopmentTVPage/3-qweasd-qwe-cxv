    "transcripts": "Today we made risotto, it's a little interpretation of the risotto milanese. Of course we added a little bit of a tomatoes to it, we added some cream to it, which is a little bit of a variation of the classic risotto milaneses. We start with a little bit of oil, heat that up until its not really hot, but warm. Add our minced onions and begin to saute those until they're translucent or soft. Then we're going to add our rice to that and can cook our rice with the onions, we want to cook it until it's almost toasted just a little bit. It's not a color, but it's an aroma, so if you smell your rice before you add it and then you begin to smell you're rice you know two or three minutes after you've sauteed it you can almost get this little toasted kind of aroma from the rice which is important. Then we're going to deglaze it with our white wine in this case we're using a very dry white wine a Sauvignon Blanc and we want to cook that until all the alcohol is evaporated. There we're going to start to add our hot stock and continue to cook it until our rice is to the texture that we like and want to make sure that our stock is hot. It's very important that when you're adding your stock to your risotto that the stock maintains a simmer. It's very important to maintain that simmer so that it doesn't interrupt the cooking rice. Then we're finishing up with some saffron in this case some tomatoes of course some butter, some sweet butter, some whip cream, Parmesan cheese, and then finally some beautiful olive oil on top.",

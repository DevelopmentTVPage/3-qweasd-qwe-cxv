    "transcripts": "I really love lamb shoulder, number one it's got so much flavor and texture to the it's uh. It's it's a piece of meat that is kind of ignored. We take the bone out of it and we're just adding a marinate if you will. Uhm it's it's mustard, herbs and we spread that on the interior of the lamb and let that sit for 24 hours. We trust it and then we were going to roast it, pan roast it to get a really nice crust on it if you will take that out and then were going to add our vegetables. I like one pot cooking so this is this is one of those recipes where your whole dinner or your whole meal is prepared in the one rondo and the rondo is such a beautiful piece to use for this. And then we put the lamb back on top and roast it till it reaches an internal temperature about 1\/31\/32 and then with an take it out let it rest for about a half an hour. So that the tempter comes up to about 135. During that time we're going to finish our vegetables. I just finished sauteing them off a little more giving them a little more golden color to them, adding a little bit of the seasoning to it, and some salt, some herbs, a little bit of butter and then finish with our sauce making it a little vinegar reduction and adding our lamb juice to that and then by that time we're all ready to go and enjoy this wonderful pure bred lamb shoulder.",
